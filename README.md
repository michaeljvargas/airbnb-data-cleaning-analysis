 Airbnb Data Cleaning and Preparation Project

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world Airbnb dataset using a business-focused analytics workflow aligned with the CRISP-DM methodology. The goal was not just to clean data technically, but to prepare it in a way that supports stakeholder decision-making, pricing analysis, and operational insights.

- Project Objectives

Identify and handle missing values

Remove low-value or redundant columns

Convert incorrect data types into usable formats

Detect and remove duplicate records

Prepare a clean dataset ready for downstream analytics and transformation

- Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Google Colab

- Business Context

Airbnb teams rely on clean and consistent listing data to power dashboards, pricing models, and operational decisions. During this project, cleaning decisions were made with business value in mind — prioritizing columns that influence pricing, availability, and guest experience.

- Key Data Preparation Steps

Filled missing values using median-based strategies to reduce bias

Converted price fields from text to numeric format

Removed descriptive columns with limited analytical value

Validated uniqueness of listing IDs to prevent inflated metrics

Exported a clean dataset ready for further transformation

- Next Steps

This dataset will be used in a follow-up project focused on data transformation and feature engineering.
